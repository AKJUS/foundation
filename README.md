# The Commonhaus

The Commonhaus, inspired by the legacy of [The Codehaus][codehaus], is more than just a foundation. It's a collaborative environment, a shared space where innovation thrives, and where projects remain the focus. We aim to provide a neutral home where longevity, security, and innovation converge.

## Goals

**Content Creation**: Champion the development of innovative tools, libraries, and frameworks, enabling the community to build groundbreaking solutions.

**Ecosystem Health**: Prioritize the security, longevity, and accessibility of Commonhaus projects.

**Open Source Assurance**: Guarantee the community that all code under our banner will remain open source, ensuring consistent, long-term availability in trusted repositories like Maven Central.

**Project Autonomy**: Empower project maintainers with the freedom to define their governance. Our foundation strives for simplicity, eliminating 'pay-to-play' models and minimizing administrative overhead.

## Unique Characteristics

**Preservation of Project Identity**: Unlike many foundations where projects get absorbed into the larger brand, at The Commonhaus, projects not only retain but celebrate their original identities. While domain names and trademarks are donated, they don't dissolve into the foundation's overarching brand. Your project remains unmistakably yours.

**Simplified Governance with Core Principles**: We believe in an uncluttered approach with only two non-negotiable tenets:

- **Transparency**: Whatever your governance model – be it single-vendor driven, a benevolent dictator system, or a cooperative consensus approach – it's welcome here. All we ask is clarity. Document how your project is run so everyone's on the same page.

- **[Succession Planning][succession]**: While we encourage autonomy, The Commonhaus requires administrative rights to project assets. This is not for oversight but to ensure that if a project's original stewards move on, the project can continue to thrive and serve the community. This is our commitment to the long-term health and sustainability of every project under our roof.

**Empowerment Over Enforceability:** The Commonhaus isn't about restrictive walls or ceilings. It's about providing a foundation (quite literally) that lets each project rise and expand in its unique trajectory. Our role is more of a facilitator than a regulator.

## Focus of The Commonhaus

**Action Over Deliberation:** At The Commonhaus, we're about rolling up our sleeves and diving into the code. We cherish projects that yield tangible results, drive innovation, and move the needle forward. Specifically:

- **Application Frameworks**: We appreciate robust tools and platforms that streamline application development and deployment.
- **Libraries**: Our doors are always open for sets of functionality that developers can readily integrate and utilize.
- **Functional Projects**: We celebrate endeavors that address real-world challenges, offering practical solutions to pressing problems.
- **Dependencies**: Seamless support and integration with critical repositories like Maven Central are paramount.

While discourse and discussion are valuable, The Commonhaus distinguishes itself by prioritizing projects that 'do' over those that 'discuss'. Hence, we generally steer clear from:

- Theoretical specifications without practical applications.
- API-only projects that merely relate to such specifications.
- Extended working groups, SIGs, or any entity primarily focused on protracted deliberations without tangible results.
- Political games and unnecessary bureaucracy.

## Community Affiliation

**No Pay-to-Play:** The foundation will not require monetary contributions for participation.

**Volunteer Board:** Comprising user group leaders, owners of longstanding libraries and application frameworks, and other community leaders.

**Licensing:** Adherence to open source licensing as defined by the OSI.

### Sponsorship Dynamics:

At the Commonhaus, transparency and utility drive our sponsorship structure. As we evolve and pinpoint specific needs and initiatives, we're committed to keeping our community updated on fund allocations.

**Direct Project Support:** In contrast to some foundations, when you sponsor a project within the Commonhaus realm, a substantial part – if not all – of your contribution directly empowers the project maintainers in their mission.

**Foundation Support:** Directly sponsoring the foundation reinforces our collective ability to back member projects and vital ecosystem pillars, such as Maven Central. In tandem with infrastructure partners, we aim to mitigate costs associated with maintaining Commonhaus projects.
