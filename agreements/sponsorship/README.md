# Sponsoring the Commonhaus Foundation

The Commonhaus Foundation focuses on individual contributors and the open source projects they maintain.
Our corporate sponsors amplify our impact, enabling us to provide better support, resources, and programs for our projects and our members.

Through our sponsorship program, organizations strengthen the foundation's ability to provide a stable, long-term home for open source projects.
Beyond covering operational and legal costs, sponsorship allows us to develop shared resources and services that benefit all of our projects and members.
