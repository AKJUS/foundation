# Commonhaus member expectations

All participants in Commonhaus projects and groups must follow the
[Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

Commonhaus members are expected to be respectful of different viewpoints and work collaboratively with one another in a manner that constructively elevates all contributors.

If a member has an objection or dissent they should express it as early as possible to ensure there is ample time to discuss and reach consensus.

## Commonhaus leadership expectations

There are further expectations for
members of leadership teams including the
[Commonhaus Council][cc].

[cc]: GOVERNANCE.md#commonhaus-council "Commonhaus Council"

When decisions are made within the established guidelines and policies of Commonhaus projects, *those in leadership roles have a responsibility to uphold and respect the decision even if they disagree with it*. Should the leader be unwilling or unable to do so, then they should resign their leadership position.

This does not mean that decisions are set in stone. Commonhaus projects and the CC are always able to revisit decisions at a later time.

Members of CC must also conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. Some general guidelines include:

- Remediate quickly when you realize you made a mistake. We are all human, we all make mistakes, and we all have bad days. 
  - Acknowledge that you made a mistake
  - Aim to remediate first, and then discuss.
  - If other members of the team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by stopping the actions in question and discuss within the team to come to a common agreement.
- Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest standards of ethical conduct. Avoid preferential treatment.
- Criticize ideas rather than people. Discuss any concerns in person whenever possible. Take responsibility for our statements.
- Build trust by keeping your promises. The corollary: don't over-promise.
- Be a model of accountability and leadership.
  Provide the example of ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
- Demonstrate a willingness to listen and learn from others.

While the guidelines above focus primarily on the spaces where we participate in official Commonhaus work (GitHub, IRC, meetings, conferences), it is important to recognize that the public behavior of members also reflects on the Commonhaus projects and groups.

If it appears that any member of the leadership groups are acting outside of the expectations set above please refer to our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) policy which outlines the process of making an official complaint.

This policy, and changes to it, are not retroactive.
