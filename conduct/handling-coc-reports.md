# Handling reports and escalation

This document describes the proposed process and relevant roles for handling Code of Conduct (CoC) reports and escalations.

This process covers two types of reports based on the [Commonhaus Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md):

* Reports managed by the [Commonhaus Council (CC)][cc] which come in through `report@mailing-list`
* Escalations managed by the [Commonhaus Code of Conduct Panel (COCP)][cocp] which come in through `coc-escalation@mailing-list`.

Generally, reports to `coc-escalation` should refer to a report that was already submitted to `report@mailing-list` or a Commonhaus project's reporting email.

A report to `coc-esclation` should either (a) reference the previously raised issue, or (b) include an explanation of why the reporter does not feel comfortable using the project or CC reporting email for the initial report.

[cc]: ../COUNCIL_CHARTER.md "Commonhaus Council"
[cc-dm]: ../COUNCIL_CHARTER.md#decision-making-and-voting
[coc]: ../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
[cocp]: #code-of-conduct-panel "Code of Conduct Panel"

## Code of Conduct

The Commonhaus and its member projects use the [Contributor Covenant v2.1][v2.1] as its CoC. Refer to the [Code of Conduct][coc] for the full text of the CoC and the reporting and esclation procedures.

## Conflict of Interest

Any member of the [CC][cc] or [CoCP][cocp] who is involved in the report should recuse themselves from the discussions.

## Relevant roles

Note: We understand that the **reporter** and the **target** can be separate persons. In this case those reviewing the report will communicate with the reporter unless the target gives permission for the reviewer to communicate with them.

## Reports to `report@mailing-list`

All members of the CC are subscribed to the `report@mailing-list` mailing list. Members of the CC will be documented in the `commonhaus-council` [MEMBERSHIP](MEMBERSHIP.yaml) attribute.

When a report is received the following actions will be taken:

1. One of the CC members will respond to the reporter or target confirming that the report has been received. When possible the same person who responds initially will act as the point of contact for future conversations.

2. If no response has been sent by the next CC meeting, the CC chair will ensure there is a private session in which one of the CC members is identified as the point of contact.

3. The point of contact will then ensure the following steps are completed:

   1. *Report is acknowledged*: The contact person responds to let the reporter or target know that the report is being discussed.
   2. *Information gathering*: Time is allocated to collect information in one place to make sure everyone involved has access.
   3. *Information is discussed*: The facts are discussed in context of opinions. This can be done in the issue for the report, or in a meeting in which case the key discussion points should then be added to the issue.
   4. *An appropriate response is determined*: The appropriate action is decided by consensus as per the standard [CC decision making process][cc-dm].
   5. *Resolution shared:* The resolution is shared with the reporter or target by the contact person. If the reporter or target expresses concerns then the contact person will bring these back to the CC members for further discussion. 
       - This cycle can continue until the CC members reach consensus that the reporter or target's concerns have been adquately addressed. 
       - If no feedback is received within 7 days the resolution is considered as accepted.
   6. *Final resolution*: the resolution agreed by the CC members is implemented and the outcome reported to the reporter or target by the main contact.

## Reports to `coc-escalation@mailing-list`

All members of the [Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)][cocp]
are subscribed to the `coc-escalation@mailing-list` mailing list. 

Members of the CoCP will be documented in the `cocp-panel` [MEMBERSHIP](MEMBERSHIP.yaml) attribute.

The CoCP will follow the same overall procedure as the CC, with the following exceptions: 

- The Commonhaus Council chair will ensure a member of the CoCP is identified as the main point of contact either through email or scheduling a meeting for the CoCP.

- When an appropriate response has been determined by the CoCP, the proposed action is discussed with leaders of the relevant group (the CC or the Commonhaus project). If the leadership representatives expresses concerns then the contact person will bring these back to the CoCP members for further discussion. This cycle can continue until the CoCP members reach consensus that the leadership representatives concerns have been adequately addressed.
