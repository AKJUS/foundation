# The Commonhaus Foundation Project Governance

The Commonhaus Foundation is where things get done.
However, we're all humans, and, inevitably, humans can be complex.
This document clarifies how we work together to drive the foundation and its projects forward.

## Project Roles

**Contributors:** Anyone who engages with the project in any capacity, from providing feedback, reporting issues to submitting code changes.

**Code Owners:** Individuals or groups with the authority to review and merge contributions and direct the project's course.
  - Access: They have write permissions to the repository.
  - Reference: Managed through the repository's `CODEOWNERS` file.

## Commonhaus Council

The Commonhaus Council (CC) is the governing body of The Commonhaus Foundation. 

The council convenes regularly to:

- Ensure the vitality and sustainability of projects.
- Bolster collaboration between projects.
- Uphold the foundation's values and standards, which includes reviewing Code of Conduct violations.

Agendas and schedules for these assemblies will be released ahead of time. 
Meetings open to the broader public will welcome all members and interested observers.

### Composition and Membership

The Council is comprised of 10 elected members (1 year terms), and 1 elected [Council Chairperson](#chairperson-of-the-council) (2 year term)

**Eligibility:** Active contributors to the foundation's projects are eligible. 
Their active participation helps ensure the council understands challenges member projects are facing.

**Participation Expectations:** An elected member is anticipated to be an active voice in discussions, share their expertise, and collaborate with fellow CC members to ensure The Commonhaus Foundation and its projects flourish.

**Nomination and Election:** Any active contributor to Commonhaus projects is eligible, either through self-nomination or through nomination by peers. Elections focus on an individual's commitment to The Commonhaus Foundation, their expertise, and the unique perspectives they bring. To stave off undue influence, no single company or entity can occupy more than a third of the Council's seats.

**Tenure and Transition:** After serving their term, members can either run for re-election, endorse another nominee, or step back, making room for new blood.

#### Chairperson of the Council

The Chairperson orchestrates regular CC meetings, ensuring leadership in discussions is evenly spread. They also oversee the proper handling of [Code of Conduct reports and escalations][coc-reports].

## Decision Making and Voting

True to Open Source roots, The Commonhaus Foundation follows a Lazy Consensus decision making model. To quote the [Consensus definition](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html) from the Apache Foundation: 

> Consensus
>
> The word ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù is a bit ambiguous in English, and so can lead to some misunderstandings of intent when we use it in the context of project decisions. Consensus does not mean that everyone agrees on all details. Rather, it means that the project, as a whole, has arrived a decision, or at least a compromise, that everyone can live with.
>
> Lazy Consensus
>
> Lazy consensus is the first, and possibly the most important, consensus-building tool we have. Essentially lazy consensus means that you don‚Äôt need to get explicit approval to proceed, but you need to be prepared to listen if someone objects.

When seeking consensus, members should express objections or dissent as early as possible to ensure there is time to discuss and address objections.

### Seeking consensus in meetings

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CC member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CC or else the discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all Voting CC members for, or against, the issue wins.
A Voting CC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

### Seeking consensus on mailing lists

When seeking consensus in mailing lists, it is important to leave enough time (at least 72-hours) for everyone to read the email and respond with opinions and objections.

CC members should consider the following when drafting consensus-seeking email:
  - Use a leading indicator (`[DISCUSS]` or an emoji like üó≥Ô∏è) to mark consensus-seeking email
  - Use a clear subject line that summarizes the topic
  - If there is a time constraint to the decision, include it in the subject.

It is customary for the initiator to post a summary once it appears that consensus has been reached, to ensure that their understanding is accurate.
