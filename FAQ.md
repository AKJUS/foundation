# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Why create a new foundation?

There are already several foundations which host open source projects,
and each has its own focus and requirements.
The CF is a home for self-governing, code-centric open source projects.
Each open source project has its own unique needs and goals,
and not every foundation is the right fit for every project.

There are many critical application frameworks and libraries within the open source ecosystem that are not currently part of a foundation.
The CF is a new option for projects to consider when looking for a foundation to call home,
helping to strengthen the open source ecosystem as a whole by ensuring more projects are sustainable in the long term.

## Why not the Apache Software Foundation?

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is renowned for its support of a diverse range of open-source projects, offering a structured environment with specific infrastructure requirements, including mailing lists, and a governance model centered around the Apache Software License (Apache-2.0).  While ASF provides a robust framework for project development, projects with established infrastructures and governance models might seek to retain their existing systems.

The CF respects the autonomy of projects, allowing them to maintain their current infrastructure and processes upon joining. We offer flexibility in licensing, supporting a broader array of OSI-approved licenses beyond the Apache-2.0.

## Why not the Eclipse Foundation?

The Eclipse Foundation (EF) has been around almost as long as the ASF, and is home to many open source projects as well.
In addition to open source projects, the EF oversees specification projects, particularly in relation to JakartaEE.
A key requirement for projects joining the EF is naming a project with the prefix _Eclipse_,
to reinforce brand recognition.

At Commonhaus Foundation, we prioritize the project's brand and its community, offering a collaborative environment without mandating changes to project names or aligning strictly with our branding. While supportive of projects that implement or are based on standards, the Commonhaus Foundation does not direct its focus towards the oversight of standards or specifications development, leaving projects free to navigate these aspects as they see fit.

## Facilitating collaborative progress

Both the Apache and Eclipse Foundations offer vital structural supports where competing interests need to be navigated with care.

At Commonhaus, we see our role as facilitators of a different sort of consensus-buildingâ€”one that encourages projects to agree on how to collaborate and move forward together, without requiring a predefined structure.
We believe this approach nurtures a sense of ownership and commitment among all project stakeholders.

## Why not the Linux Foundation?

The Linux Foundation (LF) is a respected home for thousands of open-source projects, whether as part of its broader umbrella for unfunded projects or within its various sub-foundations (each with its own set of benefits and governance structures). LF Projects have the opportunity to operate with a significant degree of independence, especially as unfunded initiatives, though they may receive fewer direct benefits compared to those in sub-foundations.

Like the Linux Foundation, the Commonhaus Foundation aims to be a welcoming home for open-source projects, offering an alternative for those seeking a community with shared interests and a more tailored support structure. We provide a space for projects that value a smaller, more focused community engagement, highlighting our belief in fitting the foundation's support to the project's needs.

## Are there any criteria for open source technologies/specifications or programming languages used by projects under the CF?

There are no restrictions on the programming languages, technologies and/or specifications that your project uses to be part of the CF. If you think your project is a good fit for Commonhaus, [start a discussion](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/discussions/categories/joining-commonhaus).
