## The Commonhaus Council and Charter

The Commonhaus aims to a place where things get done. But we're all humans, and humans can be messy. This Charter defines how The Commonhaus and members of the Commonhaus Council will work together to keep moving the foundation and its member projects forward.

## Decision Making and Voting

True to Open Source roots, the Commonhaus follows a Lazy Consensus decision making model. To quote the [Consensus definition](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html) from the Apache Foundation: 

> Consensus
>
> The word ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù is a bit ambiguous in English, and so can lead to some misunderstandings of intent when we use it in the context of project decisions. Consensus does not mean that everyone agrees on all details. Rather, it means that the project, as a whole, has arrived a decision, or at least a compromise, that everyone can live with.

> Lazy Consensus
>
> Lazy consensus is the first, and possibly the most important, consensus-building tool we have. Essentially lazy consensus means that you don‚Äôt need to get explicit approval to proceed, but you need to be prepared to listen if someone objects.

### Seeking consensus in meetings

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CC member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CC or else the discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all Voting CC members for, or against, the issue wins.
A Voting CC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

### Seeking consensus on mailing lists

When seeking consensus in mailing lists, it is important to leave enough time (at least 72-hours) for everyone to read the email and respond with opinions and objections.

CC members should consider the following when drafting consensus-seeking email:
  - Use a leading indicator (`[DISCUSS]` or an emoji like üó≥Ô∏è) to mark consensus-seeking email
  - Use a clear subject line that summarizes the topic
  - If there is a time constraint to the decision, include it in the subject.

It is customary for the initiator to post a summary once it appears that consensus has been reached, to ensure that their understanding is accurate.
