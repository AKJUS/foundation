# Commonhaus Continuity and Administrative Access Policy

The Commonhaus understands the impact of reliable libraries and frameworks on the broader tech community. Many businesses run on applications built using these assets. It’s logical – for instance, a retailer specializing in fish tanks shouldn’t need a deep grasp of low-level internet protocols. However, time brings change. Maintainers, the nurturers of these invaluable tools, might pivot to new endeavors. In their absence, who ensures the continuity and security of these tools?

The longevity and security of projects under The Commonhaus banner address this vital concern. This policy articulates the foundation's need for administrative access to project resources and the principles that guide this requirement.

## Policy Rationale

Administrative access empowers The Commonhaus to:

**Facilitate Smooth Transitions:** Uphold project continuity when stewardship undergoes change, ensuring that important libraries and frameworks not only survive but flourish.

**CVE Remediation:** Act swiftly during security threats, especially if the primary maintainers are unreachable.

**Artifact Updates:** Provide consistent access to updated project artifacts, even amidst maintainer hiatus.

**Prevent Fragmentation:** Breathe life into projects confronting prolonged inactivity, negating the need for consuming forks.

In certain situations, like noticeable lapses in activity or a decision by project owners to step away, The Commonhaus might intervene. 
We'll delegate committed and adept successors to ascertain that projects stay alive and beneficial. 
This methodology deters resource-heavy forks and extensive overhauls. 
Additionally, as technology evolves, we will collaborate with industry partners to ensure Commonhaus projects remain informed and equipped for emerging demands.

## Scope of Access and Intervention

**Limited Interference:** Although The Commonhaus maintains administrative access, we operate with a light touch, stepping in only under the conditions mentioned above.

**Project Autonomy:** Projects need not join The Commonhaus GitHub organization. They're free to stay within their preferred GitHub (or Gitlab, BitBucket, etc.) organization and/or repository.

**Transparent Communication:** Any exercise of administrative privilege by The Commonhaus will be transparently relayed to the project maintainers and, when appropriate, the wider community.

## Commitment to Project Stewards and the Community

The Commonhaus respects each project's chosen governance model. This policy complements, not supersedes, those models. We recommend projects to:

- Maintain a `GOVERNANCE.md` detailing decision-making processes and contact information. The Commonhaus must direct contact details (kept confidential) for emergencies or coordination in the case of an extended absence.

- Have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear build and test instructions. It should explain criteria for contributions, versioning practices, and preferences in the event of a maintainer transition.

### Policy Review and Updates

This policy may undergo periodic reviews and updates to cater to the evolving needs of The Commonhaus and its projects. Project stewards and the community will be involved in and informed of any changes.
