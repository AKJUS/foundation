# The Commonhaus Foundation Continuity and Administrative Access Policy

The Commonhaus Foundation understands the impact of reliable libraries and frameworks on the broader tech community. Many businesses run on applications built using these assets, and it is logical for them to do so. A retailer specializing in fish tanks shouldnâ€™t need a deep grasp of low-level internet protocols. However, time brings change. Maintainers, the nurturers of these invaluable tools, might pivot to new endeavors. In their absence, who ensures the continuity and security of these tools?

The Commonhaus Foundation aims to help projects address this vital concern. 

This policy articulates the foundation's need for administrative access to project resources and the principles that guide this requirement.

## Policy Rationale

Administrative access empowers The Commonhaus Foundation to:

**Facilitate Smooth Transitions:** Provide continuity when stewardship changes or after prolonged inactivity, ensuring that important libraries and frameworks can survive without expensive forks.

**CVE Remediation:** Act swiftly during security threats, especially if the primary maintainers are unreachable.

**Artifact Updates:** Provide consistent access to updated project artifacts, even amidst maintainer hiatus.

The Commonhaus Foundation may intervene in certain situations, but we will exhaust every option to contact the current maintainers before we do so.
For libraries under heavy use, we will encourage a "path of least disturbance" approach to provide stability for applications relying on these libraries. 

## Scope of Access and Intervention

**Limited Interference:** Although The Commonhaus Foundation maintains administrative access, we operate with a light touch, stepping in only under the conditions mentioned above.

**Project Autonomy:** Projects need not join The Commonhaus Foundation GitHub organization. They're free to stay within their preferred GitHub (or Gitlab, BitBucket, etc.) organization and/or repository.

**Transparent Communication:** Any exercise of administrative privilege by The Commonhaus Foundation will be recorded and communicated to the project maintainers.

## Commitment to Project Stewards and the Community

The Commonhaus Foundation respects each project's chosen governance model. This policy complements, and does not supersede, those models. We recommend projects:

- Maintain `GOVERNANCE.md` detailing decision-making processes and contact information. The Commonhaus Foundation must have direct contact details (kept confidential) for emergencies or coordination in the case of an extended absence.

- Maintain `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear build, test, and packaging instructions. It should explain criteria for contributions, versioning practices, and preferences in the event of a maintainer transition.

### Policy Review and Updates

This policy may undergo periodic reviews and updates to cater to the evolving needs of The Commonhaus Foundation and its projects. Project stewards and the community will be involved in and informed of any changes.
