# The Commonhaus Foundation Trademark Policy

## Introduction

This Trademark Policy outlines the policy of The Commonhaus Foundation regarding the ownership, use, and licensing of its trademarks. For purposes of this document, references to trademarks or marks include all trade and service marks and logos owned by The Commonhaus Foundation legal entity.

## Trademark Ownership and Specific Project Trademarks

The Commonhaus Foundation owns all Commonhaus trademarks, both registered and unregistered. A comprehensive list of Commonhaus registered trademarks, pending registrations, and trademarks in use can be found at https://trademark-list.website.

While all trademarks are owned by The Commonhaus Foundation, each project under Commonhaus may have its own (unique) set of trademarks. These trademarks, along with any specific usage rules, will be documented in the project's `TRADEMARK.md` file. 

In case of any inconsistency between the rules in a project's `TRADEMARK.md` file and this Trademark Policy, the project's specific rules will prevail.

## The Commonhaus Foundation Trademark Usage Guidelines

Trademarks ensure that the community recognizes and trusts the quality of associated products or services. This policy balances two main interests:

1. Introduction
2. Trademark Ownership and Specific Project Trademarks
3. The Commonhaus Foundation Trademark Usage Guidelines
4. Rules that Apply to Trademarks In General
5. Commonhaus Trademarks and Crowdfunding
6. Questions, Comments, Concerns
7. Disclaimer
8. Modifications and Updates

Your right to use any Commonhaus trademarks is defined in this policy, in any statement accompanying the trademark notice on our project websites, and in the `TRADEMARK.md` file specific to each Commonhaus project.
Remember, while copyright licenses, even open source ones, allow you to use the associated software, they don't grant trademark rights.
Just because you can modify open-source software doesn't automatically give you rights to use Commonhaus trademarks. Your rights depend on whether you meet the standards the specific trademark stands for.

Following these guidelines protects the value of Commonhaus trademarks. 
Any use of or reference to Commonhaus trademarks that is inconsistent with this policy, or use of marks that might be confused with Commonhaus trademarks, is prohibited. 
All uses of the Commonhaus trademarks, and all goodwill associated therewith, will inure solely to the benefit of The Commonhaus Foundation and Commonhaus projects.

## Rules that Apply to Trademarks In General

There are some basic rules that apply to any use of any trade or service mark that you do not own, including any mark of The Commonhaus Foundation, without the express permission of the owner.

- A trademark should never be used as a verb or noun.  A trademark should be used only as an adjective followed by the generic name/noun.
- A trademark should not be used in the plural or possessive form.
- A trademark should not be altered or amended in any way.  A mark should not be combined with any other mark, hyphenated, abbreviated or displayed in parts.  A trademark that is depicted as two or more words should not be compressed into one word. A logo should not be displayed with color variations, or with other elements superimposed on top of the logo.
- A trademark should not be used as your domain name or as part of your domain name.
- A trademark should not be used as part of your product name.
- A trademark should not be incorporated into your company’s logos or designs.
- A trademark notice should be used on the most prominent and/or first appearance of each mark, and a trademark notice should not be changed.  In particular, a ™ should not be changed to an ® in a trademark notice by anyone other than the owner.  If you are unsure about whether a mark is registered in your country, please contact us for additional guidance as to what trademark symbol you should use.

There are also some basic rights that everyone has to use any trademark, which are often referred to as “fair use,” and The Commonhaus Foundation does not intend to restrict those rights.
You may make fair use of word marks to make true factual statements.
But fair use does not permit you to state or imply that the owner of a mark produces, endorses, or supports your company, products, or services.
Even when making fair use of a trademark, you should acknowledge the owner of the trademark with a trademark notice, such as the notice displayed on Commonhaus project websites.

## Commonhaus Trademarks and Crowdfunding

The Commonhaus Foundation recognizes that some projects may wish to use a project trademark when raising funds through crowdfunding platforms.
These activities are not official Commonhaus Foundation efforts, even if they are coordinated by core participants from our projects. 
Because crowdfunding is an individual activity organized outside of The Commonhaus Foundation, you must ask permission to use a Commonhaus trademark on a crowdfunding page.

In exchange for using the mark, the Commonhaus requires the administrator of the crowdfunding effort to adhere to these three policies:

1. You must have a policy that contributors and recipients disclose their legal or known names and company affiliations to the administrator of the funds.

2. Projects must be clear about how they decide to distribute funds to individual contributors.

3. You must include the following disclaimer on the crowdfunding page, replacing [Project Name] with the name of the project whose logo you plan to use:

> "This crowdfunding page supports independent contributors of the [Project Name] open source project. 
> The Commonhaus doesn't endorse, administer, or control this page. 
> Donations made here will go directly to the individuals contributing to [Project Name], and not to The Commonhaus. 
> The [Project Name] marks are used under license from The Commonhaus for the open source community's benefit."

To request permission to use a mark, please contact `info@mailing-list`.

Finally, if you are raising money through crowdfunding, be aware that you are not acting on behalf of The Commonhaus Foundation. It is your responsibility to know and follow all applicable laws.

## Questions, Comments, Concerns

We look to our community to help us retain the value of The Commonhaus Foundation trade and service marks.

If you have questions with respect to these guidelines or to report concerns regarding the use or misuse of a trademark of The Commonhaus Foundation, or to obtain written permission for a proposed use of Commonhaus trademarks, contact `info@mailing-list`.

## Disclaimer

The Commonhaus Foundation does not make any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of any third party intellectual property rights. 

The Commonhaus Foundation does not warrant that any pending trademark applications for Commonhaus trademarks will result in any granted trademark protection. 

The Commonhaus Foundation shall not be liable for any claims relating to user’s activities taken under the permissions granted by this policy. You (the user of Commonhaus Trademarks) hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the The Commonhaus Foundation and its contributors harmless against any such claims.

## Modifications and Updates

The Commonhaus Foundation reserves the right to modify or update this Trademark Policy at any time. It's your responsibility to remain informed about the current trademark guidelines.
