# Commonhaus Trademark Policy

## Introduction

This Trademark Policy outlines the policy of Commonhaus regarding the ownership, use, and licensing of its trademarks. For purposes of this document, references to trademarks or marks include all trade and service marks and logos owned by The Commonhaus legal entity.

## Trademark Ownership and Specific Project Trademarks

The Commonhaus owns all Commonhaus trademarks, both registered and unregistered. A comprehensive list of Commonhaus registered trademarks, pending registrations, and trademarks in use can be found at https://trademark-list.website.

While all trademarks are owned by the Commonhaus, each project under Commonhaus may have its own (unique) set of trademarks. These trademarks, along with any specific usage rules, will be documented in the project's `TRADEMARK.md` file. 

In case of any inconsistency between the rules in a project's `TRADEMARK.md` file and this Trademark Policy, the project's specific rules will prevail.

## The Commonhaus Trademark Usage Guidelines

Trademarks ensure that the community recognizes and trusts the quality of associated products or services. This policy balances two main interests:

1. Ensuring that Commonhaus trademarks retain their value as unique identifiers for The Commonhaus and Commonhaus projects.
2. Allowing community members to discuss related projects and describe the relationship between The Commonhaus, Commonhaus projects, and third-party products or services.

Your right to use any of The Commonhaus trademarks is defined in this policy, in any statement accompanying the trademark notice on our project websites, and in the `TRADEMARK.md` file specific to each Commonhaus project.
Remember, while copyright licenses, even open source ones, allow you to use the associated software, they don't grant trademark rights.
Just because you can modify open-source software doesn't automatically give you rights to use The Commonhaus trademarks. Your rights depend on whether you meet the standards the specific trademark stands for.

Following these guidelines ensures the rotects
the value of the The Commonhaus trademarks. 
Any use of or reference to Commonhaus trademarks that is inconsistent with this policy, or use of marks that might be confused with Commonhaus trademarks, is prohibited. 
All uses of the Commonhaus trademarks, and all goodwill associated therewith, will inure solely to the benefit of the Commonhaus and Commonhaus projects.

## Commonhaus Trademarks and Crowdfunding

The Commonhaus recognizes that some projects may wish to use a project trademark when raising funds through crowdfunding platforms.
These activities are not official Commonhaus efforts, even
if they are coordinated by core participants from our projects. 
Because crowdfunding is an individual activity organized outside of the Commonhaus, you must ask permission to use a Commonhaus trademark on a crowdfunding page.

In exchange for using the mark, the Commonhaus requires the administrator of the crowdfunding effort to adhere to these three policies:

1. You must have a policy that contributors and recipients disclose their legal or known names and company affiliations to the administrator of the funds.

2. Projects must be clear about how they decide to distribute funds to individual contributors.

3. You must include the following disclaimer on the crowdfunding page, replacing [Project Name] with the name of the project whose logo you plan to use:

> "This crowdfunding page supports independent contributors of the [Project Name] open source project. 
> The Commonhaus doesn't endorse, administer, or control this page. 
> Donations made here will go directly to the individuals contributing to [Project Name], and not to The Commonhaus. 
> The [Project Name] marks are used under license from The Commonhaus for the open source community's benefit."

To request permission to use a mark, please contact `info@mailing-list`.

Finally, if you are raising money through crowdfunding, be aware that you are not acting on behalf of the
Commonhaus. It is your responsibility to know and follow all applicable laws

The Commonhaus does not warrant that any pending trademark applications for trademarks of the Commonhaus will
result in any granted trademark protection.

relating to user’s activities taken under the permissions granted by this policy. You (the user of Commonhaus Trademarks) hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Commonhaus and its contributors harmless against any such claims.
