# Commonhaus Intellectual Property Policy

The Commonhaus supports various individual projects, collectively known as “Projects”. Any new code contributions to these Projects are made under the license chosen by each individual Project (termed as the “Project Code License”).

1. **License Choices:** The technical governing body of each Project can opt for any of the following as its Project Code License:
   - [The Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
   - [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
   - [The 2-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
   - [The 3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

   Alternatively, a different open source license can be selected with approval from the [Commonhaus Council (CC)][cc].

1. **Interactions with Upstream Projects:** The Commonhaus and its Projects might collaborate with other open source projects (“Upstream Projects”). In such cases, they will:

   - Adhere to all licensing requirements of the Upstream Projects.
   - Aim for compatibility with projects integrated into the Projects.

   If there's a need for an alternative license due to an Upstream Project, the CC can approve an exception. For such approvals, please contact `info@mailing-list`.

2. **Contribution Details:** Unless approved by the CC:

   - All new code contributions should be made under the Project Code License, backed by a [Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO)](http://developercertificate.org/).
   - All provided code will be available under the Project Code License.
   - All documentation and media files will be contributed under a license chosen by the Project’s technical governing body, such as:
     - [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
     - [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

   All contributed files should be labeled with license information.

3. **Policy Modifications:** The CC, after notifying the Projects, may change contribution policies.

4. **Additional Contribution Requirements:** A Project might enforce extra requirements, like being accompanied by a Commonhaus CLA.

5. **Intellectual Property Rights:** Membership in The Commonhaus does not imply any granting or receipt of intellectual property rights, except where stated by this policy, the Project Code License, or the Project Documentation License.
