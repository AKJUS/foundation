# Commonhaus IP Policy Guidance

The purpose of this guide is to make it straightforward for projects to follow the [Commonhaus IP Policy][IP Policy].

Of course, the source of truth remains the [IP Policy][].

If in doubt about anything related to IP after reading this document, first read the [IP Policy][], and then [ask for help](#getting-help).

## Basic IP requirements

There are four key IP requirements for all Commonhaus projects:

1. [Licensing](#1-licensing)
2. [Copyright notices](#2-copyright-notices)
3. Displaying the [standard website footer](#3-standard-website-footer) on the project's website
4. [Adopting the DCO or a CLA](#4-adopting-the-dco-or-a-cla)

### 1. Licensing

Code may be licensed under:
  * [Apache, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
  * [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  * [2-Clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
  * [3-Clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

Documentation may be licensed under:
  * [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
  * [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

If you need to use a license which isn't in the [IP Policy][], you will [need to obtain an exemption](#obtaining-an-exemption).

### 2. Copyright notices

The recommendation is to use a general copyright statement of the following form (where XYZ is the project's name):

- **Copyright The XYZ Authors.**
- **Copyright The XYZ Contributors.**
- **Copyright Contributors to the XYZ project.**

By using this format, the project avoids having to deal with names of copyright holders, years or ranges of years, and variations on the (c) symbol.

_Please note that you **must not** change or remove existing copyright lines unless you put them there **and** have the right to do so.
If there are existing copyright lines add the recommended copyright statement below the existing copyright lines._

### 3. Standard website footer

All project websites need to have a [standard website footer][].

### 4. Adopting the DCO or a CLA

Each project must adopt either the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)][DCO] or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

## Obtaining an exemption

If your project requires an exemption from the [IP Policy][], you will need to obtain special permission from the [Commonhaus Council (CC)][cc].
