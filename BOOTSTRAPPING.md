# Commonhaus Foundation Bootstrapping Agreement

This document outlines the preliminary, non-binding agreement for the establishment phase of the Commonhaus Foundation (CF), aiming to foster a collaborative community dedicated to open-source projects.

[cfc]: ./bylaws/3-cf-council.md
[cc-dm]: ./bylaws/5-decision-making.md

## Preliminary Commitment

Projects signal their intent to join the CF without any legal transfer of assets during this preliminary phase.

- [?] Clarification on Projects' Role and Contributions: Define the expected contributions and engagement level from each project during this phase.

## Quorum Establishment

A minimum number of projects, or "quorum," is required for moving forward with binding commitments.

- [?] Mechanics of Quorum Establishment: Detail the process and criteria for establishing and meeting the quorum.

## Formation Period

Post-organization, there is a Formation Period for projects to contribute to CF's foundational structures and processes.

Decisions should follow (and refine) the [CF decision making process][cc-dm].


## Binding Commitments Post-Formation

Projects commit to binding agreements such as trademark donations after the Formation Period, contingent upon continued quorum support.


If fewer than the quorum decide to commit their trademarks after the Formation Period, the remaining projects have the right to withdraw their membership without any penalties or obligations.

- [?] Transition to Binding Commitments: Define the criteria and process for transitioning from non-binding to binding commitments.

## Feedback and Iteration

Regular feedback sessions will address concerns, suggest changes, and ensure alignment with collective goals.

- [?] Feedback Mechanism Implementation: Establish how feedback will be collected, reviewed, and utilized.

## Acknowledgement

By signing this agreement, the undersigned representatives of the participating projects acknowledge their understanding of these terms and express their non-binding intent to support the establishment of the Commonhaus Foundation.
